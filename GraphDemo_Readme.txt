The GraphDemo.jar file should be run from the command prompt (java -jar GraphDemo.jar).  It runs through some sample scenarios of creating, manipulating, and querying the graph.  The demo does not intend to demonstrate all functionality of the Graph, but to highlight the main features.  It will also save the graph to a file called Graph2File, and then it will read it back in.  The file will be created in the same location where the GraphDemo.jar resides.
