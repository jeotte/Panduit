# Panduit
Java Assignment (as part of the hiring process at Panduit)

A graph data structure with the ability to add/remove edges/vertices and find the shortest path.  Includes unit tests.

There exists a GraphDemo.jar which will run through sample scenarios; it is best run through the command prompt so that the output can be seen.

The JavaAssignment_EclipseProject.zip is the exported project directly from eclipse.  Used Eclipse Neon (4.6) and Java 1.8.
