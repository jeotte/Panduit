Java Assignment

A small graph library to create (add edges and vertices), manipulate (add/remove edges and
vertices) and query (retrieve edges for vertex, connectedness, graph partitions) a graph data structure.  Includes unit tests.

There exists a GraphDemo.jar which will run through sample scenarios; it is best run through the command prompt so that the output can be seen.

The JavaAssignment_EclipseProject.zip is the exported project directly from eclipse.
